# 2024Training
Hey! If you're a little lost, this repository has code for the 2024 MARS Java training. Most code that you actually care about will be in the `src/main/java/frc/robot` folder of each project.

Training #1 was on WPILib basics, moving a CTRE motor with code, and using a controller. [See the video here!](https://youtu.be/FuBPe1_EJSs)
